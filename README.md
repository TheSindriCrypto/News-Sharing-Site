# News-Sharing-Site

This is a website that I created for a class, CSE 330: Creative and Rapid Prototype Development.

It is a simple news-sharing site that scrapes the most recent articles from Onion.com and displays them on the homescreen, allows
user configuration and commenting/rating functionality, displays randomly generated Onion articles and protects from basic hacks.
